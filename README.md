# Sorting Algorithm Benchmark

This repository contains benchmark results comparing the performance of several sorting algorithms, including mergesort.

## Frameworks Benchmarked

The following frameworks and environments were tested for performance, measured by requests per second, time per request, and data transfer rate:

- **Merge Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
