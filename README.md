# Sorting Algorithm Benchmark

This repository contains benchmark results comparing the performance of several sorting algorithms, including Merge Sort, Insertion Sort, Bubble Sort, Selection Sort.

## Frameworks Benchmarked

The following sorting algorithms were tested for performance, using 2 batch sizes of 10,000 and 100,000 integers between 0 and 100:

- **Merge Sort**
- **Insertion Sort**
- **Bubble Sort**
- **Selection Sort**
- **Quick Sort**
